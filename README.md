# mazeGame
Just a simple game I made for classes, it uses SDL2 for graphics and audio as well as a font I downloaded off of a royalty free fonts site but all other code and assets are made by me.

Also something I want to mention with the new version where I merged the linuxVersion branch with main, I have absolutely no idea if this version works on windows. 

I am pretty sure you would have to change the cmake file a bit to get SDL to link with the program, but I think everything else should work, but I have no idea since I can't really test it.
